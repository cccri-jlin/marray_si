## List of Contents

### marray_si_tables.pdf
#### Table S1
**List of selected SNPs and corresponding primers.**
[Location in article: **Material and Methods**/_SNP Selection_]

#### Table S2
**Genotypes and alleles for all candidate SNPs.**
_HCC_, hepatocellular carcinoma; _LC_, liver cirrhosis; _CH_, chronic hepatitis. _N/A_, data not available.
[Location in article: the first "data available upon request" in **Results**]

#### Table S3
**Putative paired variants of HCV-associating SNPs by linkage disequilibria.**
_Proxy_, candidate proxy variants in linkage disequilibria with those in Table 1 ("_SNP_"); _R<sup>2</sup>_, pairwise correlation coefficient; _RS_, RegulomeDB scores for regulation; _Dist_, distance in proximity between A and B (bp); _Function_, predicted function of the proxy variant; _Syn_, synonymous.
[Location in article: the second "data available upon request" in **Results**]

#### Table S4
**Stratified comparisons of significant SNPs among disease phenotypes.**
Genotypic significance is evaluated for genotypic frequencies, allele frequencies, dominant _(AA+AB/BB)_ and recessive allele models _(AA/AB+BB)_, respectively. _p_, p-values of significance of a particular subgroup compared against all three disease phenotypes (_All_) or individual subgroups. _OR_, odds ratio with 95% confidence interval shown in parentheses; red values indicate genes with call rate >80%. _"**"_, _p < 0.001_; _"-"_, not available.
[Location in article: this is the complete version of Table 3 as mentiond in **Discussion**]

#### Table S5
**Statistically overrepresented Reactome pathways for genes with candidate SNPs considered to be significant and their common interacting partners.**
Statistical criterion: _p < .05_ (log<sub>10</sub> _p < â€“1.30_) after Bonferroni correction; _RID_, Reactome pathway accession number; _BG_, number of Homo sapiens genes in specified pathway; _Found_, number of enriched genes in specified pathway; _Expected_, the number of expected genes. _FE_, fold enrichment.
[Location in article: the second "data available upon request" in **Discussion**]
